  "lede": "Producer Price Inflation (PPI) measures the price changes of goods bought and sold by UK manufacturers this month compared to the same month a year ago. PPI provides a key measure of inflation alongside other indicators such as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) and Services Producer Price Index (SPPI).PPI is split into two components: output price inflation and input price inflation. The input price indices capture changes in the cost of the material and fuel inputs that producers face whereas the output price indices capture the changing prices of goods sold by producers.This article looks at the trends in both producer price indices since 2000 and which components contribute most towards changes in each price index in recent years.",
  "more": "Annual output and input price changes follow similar trends, but with the latter tending to have higher price growth1. In Figure 1, trends in producer price inflation can be split into three distinct periods: 2000 to 2005, 2005 to 2012 and 2012 to June 2014.  Both indices experience greater variability within the second period of 2005 to 2012 than compared with the first and third period. From 2005 to 2012 the average growth rate was 2.9% for output price inflation and 8.1% for input price inflation.  The largest peaks and troughs experienced for both indices throughout the time series shown below occurred in the second period of 2005 to 2012. Output price inflation rose to 8.9% in July 2008 while input price inflation rose to 34.8% in June 2008 and both fell to their lowest rates in July 2009: output price inflation falling by 1.6% and input price inflation falling by 14.8%.",

      "markdown": "This is the latest quarterly release about Internet use by adults aged 16 years and over. Internet use is linked to various socio-economic and demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, disability, geographical location and weekly earnings. For example, those who are less likely to have used the Internet include both the elderly and disabled adults. \n\nThe estimates in this release are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and are not seasonally adjusted. ONS developed these statistics to meet the needs of users (see background note 4). There is a particular interest and focus in the UK on those who have never used the Internet.\n\nOn 8 August 2013, ONS published the annual [Internet Access â€“ Households and Individuals 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-access---households-and-individuals/2013/stb-ia-2013.html \"STB IA 2013\") statistical bulletin. The annual survey provides more information on Internet use than this quarterly update. However, while the estimates in the annual bulletin are more detailed, they are derived from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which has a smaller sample size than the LFS. Therefore comparisons made between this quarterly release and the annual publication should be undertaken with caution.\n"

      "title": "Background notes",
      "markdown": "##### 1. Key Issues Specific to this Bulletin\n\nThis is the latest quarterly release about Internet use by adults aged 16 or over. The results in this release are in respect of Q1 2014 (January to March 2014). ONS began publishing quarterly data on Internet users and non-users at Q1 2011, to enable more timely information on Internet use to be made available. The source of the information is the Labour Force Survey (LFS). A [quality report for the LFS (120.8 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/social-statistics/quality-and-methodology-information-for-the-labour-force-survey--lfs-.pdf \"Quality and Metholodgy Information for the Labour Force Survey (LFS)\") is available on the ONS website.\n\nThe new question added to the Labour Force Survey in Q1 2011 was \u0027when did you last use the Internet?\u0027 This is the same question that has been used in the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey to collect data for the annual publication â€˜Internet Access Households and Individualsâ€™.\n\nThe term â€˜disabledâ€™ is used to refer to those who self-assess that they have a disability in line with the Equality Act. Prior to Q4 2013, the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) definition of disability was used. Respondents who did not answer whether they had a disability have been included in the category \u0027No disability\u0027 in tables 1A, 1B, 7A and 7B.\n\nâ€˜Donâ€™t knowâ€™ responses are not separately identified in this bulletin. Therefore, percentage breakdowns sum to less than 100%, reflecting the small number of â€˜donâ€™t knowâ€™ responses to the Internet use question. \n\n##### 2. National Statistics\n\nUntil Q3 2012, this release was published with experimental statistics status.\n\nThe UK Statistics Authority has reviewed this publication in their report [\"Assessment of compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics: Statistics on Internet Access\"](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/stats-authority/uk-statistics-authority--assessment-of-compliance-with-the-code-of-practice-for-official-statistics--statistics-on-internet-access.html). This review recommended that the statistics published in the Internet Access Quarterly Update be designated as National Statistics, subject to ONS carrying out certain requirements. ONS has carried out the necessary work to comply with the requirements set out in this report and as a result of this; the UK Statistics Authority confirmed that from Q3 2012, this release had National Statistics status.\n\n##### 3. Revisions\n\nThere are no revisions to estimates previously published. \n\n##### 4. Users and Uses of the Data\n\nThe organisation Race Online 2012 was established to help more people get online for the first time by 2012. Race Online 2012 needed more frequent statistics on people who had never used the Internet, but this could not be met by the annual Internet Access Survey. Therefore, ONS started publishing an experimental quarterly update on Internet users and non-users. This quarterly release was expressly designed to fill this information gap.\n\nIn 2012, Race Online 2012 was replaced by a new partnership organisation, Go ON UK.\n\nWithin the UK there is wide interest in these quarterly estimates from researchers, public bodies, the media, charities and academics. The UK government is moving towards a policy of â€˜digital by defaultâ€™ in the provision of a range of public services. This is where the Internet becomes the preferred method for the delivery of services. The statistics in this release make it possible to monitor the number of people who are not online, and who are therefore unable to access public services that are delivered online. These statistics may also be used to help inform the wider debate about digital and social exclusion.\n\nAs well as user interest in adults who have ever or never used the Internet, there is also interest in adults who have used the Internet, but not recently. Therefore, in Q2 2012 new estimates of â€˜lapsed Internet usersâ€™ were introduced, showing estimates of adults who had last used the Internet more than three months ago. \n\nDo you make use of our quarterly estimates of Internet Access? If yes, we would like to hear from you (\u003cesociety@ons.gsi.gov.uk\u003e) and understand how you make use of these quarterly statistics.\n\n##### 5. Coherence\n\nThe results published in this quarterly bulletin focus on Internet users and non-users. These results are not directly comparable with the estimates contained in the annual [Internet Access â€“ Households and Individuals 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-access---households-and-individuals/2013/stb-ia-2013.html \"STB IA 2013\") statistical bulletin, which was published on 8 August 2013. The annual bulletin contains a wide range of information about Internet access and use, but from a smaller sample than the LFS.\n\nThe 2013 annual bulletin was compiled from approximately 3,000 interviews conducted for the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, whereas approximately 41,000 households respond each quarter to the LFS. The larger sample size in the LFS allows for more detailed and accurate socio-demographic analysis than is possible with the Opinions and Lifestyle dataset.\n\nIt is also important to note that the estimates in this bulletin are on a UK basis whereas the Internet Access 2013 results relate to Great Britain only.\n\n##### 6. Sampling variability\n\nThe Q1 2014 confidence intervals tables show estimated 95% confidence intervals for estimates relating to Internet users and non-users, by age and sex. The estimates, included as part of this statistical bulletin, come from survey data and so have a degree of statistical error associated with them. Confidence intervals are an indication of the reliability of the estimate; the smaller the interval, the more reliable the estimate is likely to be. With regards to â€™95% confidence intervalsâ€™, if the survey was repeated 100 times, 95% of the time (95 times out of 100), the true population value would fall within the range of these confidence intervals.\n\n#### Table A: Internet non-users, 95% confidence intervals, Q1 2014\nTable source: Office for National Statistics\n\n##### Download table: \n![XLS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/iconxls_tcm77-30132.gif \"XLS\")  [XLS format](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-access-quarterly-update/q1-2014/prt-ia-table-a.xls \"XLS format\") (28.5 Kb)\n\nThe larger the sample that is used for a particular estimate, the narrower the confidence interval will be. The higher level regional estimates are based on larger sample sizes than the lower level regional estimates.\n\n##### 7. Rounding\n\nIn all tables totals may not equal the sum of independently rounded components.\n\n##### 8.
