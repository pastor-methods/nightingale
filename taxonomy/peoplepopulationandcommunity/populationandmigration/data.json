They also consider changes to the UK population and the factors driving these changes. These statistics have a wide range of uses; they are used by central government, local government and the health sector for planning, resource allocation and managing the economy. Additionally, they are used by a wide range of people such as market researchers, academics and those in special interest groups.",
